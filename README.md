## Usage

To run this project, you have a couple ways, the first and easiest way is to install the Processing IDE, open it and run it.

If you want a cleaner way, I'd recommend installing **processing-java**. If you do that you can then just do:

```
make
```

## Installation

**I do not recommend to install this project**, but you still have the option.

make clean
```
